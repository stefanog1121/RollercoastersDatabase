# Rollercoasters Database
The culmination of a semester long final project exploring SQL in my sophmore year Database Management class, this database provides enthusiasts with data and information on various rollercoasters and the parks they reside in. We were tasked with three major components:

### Designing the Database
Having been interested in the subject for years, I began to immerse myself in the information required to set the scope of the database, primarily through the existing online Roller Coasters Database website and online communities. With this in mind, I created an entity relationship diagram to map out the entities and relationships existing between them in this scope. This served as the basis for the tables, which were kept in third normal form without partial or transitive dependencies.

### Creating the Database
With the structure defined, I collected each table's data in spreedsheets, and then used SQL to define the database tables they would populate. Proper use of primary keys, foregin keys & contraints kept the database consistent and from violating any integrity rule.

### Writing the Queries
My queries sought to demonstrate how such a database would be useful to a rollercoaster enthusiast and what kind of information can be extracted from it. Each query also had to include a specific query writing concept to demonstrate my proficency in SQL. Some queries are simple and some are much longer, but on the whole they allow the user to obtain, analyze and compare the rollercoasters, amusement parks, holiday events and coaster awards in this country.

### Writing the Queries
Creating my own queries was a big challenge because I wanted to show how each table interacts with each other while also making each query relevant to the context of the database. Although some queries were more complex than others, they all served the purpose of generating outputs that would be useful to someone seeking to obtain and analyze information about baseball players and teams.
